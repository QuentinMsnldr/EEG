# EEG
The codes stored in the EEG project repository were written by Quentin Mesnildrey. 
It proposes several functions to perform various analysis of EEG signals recorded using a 32-channels device. 
The following analysis can be performed:
  *Event Related Potential calculation and representation
  * Global field Power calcultation and representation
  * Topographic maps (topoplot() EEGLAB function)
  * 2D trajectories of EEG activity
  * Detection of amplitude traveling waves from trajectory data. 
  * Distribution of TW on scalp.
